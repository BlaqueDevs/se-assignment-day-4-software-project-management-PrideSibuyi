Waterfall

It would work best on a project that requires less of involvement of the customer, a project that solves a problem that is generic for instances creating a software that would assist valet car parkers to count how many cars drove in the parking and what time each car arrived and left.

### Solve problems that no other significant hardware can not solve but the technology mixed with the hardware can solve.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

Because everyone involved in the project will have a clear understanding of what the project is and the aim that it needs to archieve.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
